# Code to run model of dopamine responses 

This directory contains the code necessary to reproduce the simulations of dopamine responses 
(RPE, APE, novelty, salience, movement). To make sure that the code runs as expected, create an environment
with the package versions specified in ```requirements.txt```. 

Note: for the dual controller model (Fig 5) see the MATLAB code in ```models/DualModel_APEpaper_FinalCode.m```
